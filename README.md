Practising my HTML and CSS skills 

I was following Shaun (The Net Ninja), his YouTube video he made with the playlist PSD to Responsive Website. 
His videos are really but a bit outdated, I use his video to supplement my learning from Treehouse and Andrei (Udemy).
So I tried this project on my own with a mobile first apporoach, whereas Shaun videos was from a desktop aproach. I guess it really depends on the user, been learning from Treehouse to always use the mobile first approach so just got use to that practice instead. 
Nonetheless, the website is still responsive to the width of the browsers. 

***The mockup and the wireframe is slightly different with the end result.
