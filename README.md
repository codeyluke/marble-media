Practising my HTML and CSS skills 

I was following Shaun (The Net Ninja), his YouTube video he made with the playlist PSD to Responsive Website. 
His videos are really but a bit outdated, I use his video to supplement my learning from Treehouse and Andrei (Udemy).
So I tried this project on my own with a mobile first apporoach, which was different from Shaun but the result of the website is still the same. 
Just got use from the Treehouse videos to always use the mobile first approach. 

***The mockup and the wireframe is slightly different with the end result.
